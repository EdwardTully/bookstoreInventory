# bookstoreInventory

This practice session contains a store made of six slices, each containing two actions.  It simiulates a basic inventory tool for a college bookstore.
This is designed to run in the node environment.  Inspired by Codevolution cake/icecream follow along.  This project uses the redux toolkit.
