# bookstoreInventory

This practice session contains a store made of seven slices, each containing two actions.  It simiulates a basic inventory tool for a college bookstore. A slice was added for freebie bookmarks to be given away when certain books are bought. This uses the extraReducer method.
This is designed to run in the node environment.  Inspired by Codevolution cake/icecream follow along.  This project uses the redux toolkit.

Middleware logger added to replace the console.log and provide more detail to what is going on.
